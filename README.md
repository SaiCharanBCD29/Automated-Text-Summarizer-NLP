# 🧠 Automated Text Summarization Using NLP

This project explores **automated summarization of text** using a state-of-the-art NLP model.  
Given a long paragraph or article, the system automatically generates a concise summary  
highlighting the main ideas — making information easier and faster to read.

## 🔍 Why this project?
With the rise of online content, users often struggle to extract key insights quickly.  
This project demonstrates how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **pre-trained transformer models**  
can efficiently summarize long text into meaningful short summaries.

## 💡 What is implemented?
- Loads a pre-trained summarization model 
- Performs text tokenization and model inference
- Generates summaries with customizable length (min/max)
- Displays before-and-after text comparison for clarity

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- *(Optional)* Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for execution

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python summarization.py
